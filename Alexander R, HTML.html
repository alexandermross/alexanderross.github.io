<H1> Don't Make This A Habit (/H1)

I can't help but feel disappointed myself when I allow this overwhelming procrastination to lead my life. I have gotten far too comfortable in putting things off until the very last minute; which is exactly what I did for this project. I am embaressed and I know I can do better than this. <span class= "underlined> But, at the same time, sometimes doing it at all feels like overcoming the tallest mountain. </span>.</p>

<H2> Laziness and I (/H2>

I don't know if I necessarily feel guilty about being lazy sometimes. I actually think being lazy on certain days can help you gain the momentum to be not lazy again. However, I am afraid that I am allowing my lazy days to bleed over in to my work days, and then I lose the scheduled point of it all. I don't want this t keep happening, and <b> I know I have the willpower to prevent it. </b>
